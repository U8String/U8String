# TODO
- [ ] Globalization
    - [ ] Investigate if it's possible to access and reuse internal ICU/NLS/Hybrid bindings. Note: 1. CoreLib seems to rely on unchanging length case folding; 2. CoreLib scans if string is ASCII only (do better: scan and convert in place, then contribute this back) and then either calls out to ASCII or invariant logic (which uses platform-specific globalization provider)
    - [x] Figure out a proper abstraction to distribute external packages that use ICU, NLS, etc. and implement appropriate U8Comparers (see U8Abstractions, U8Comparison and U8CaseConversion)
    - [x] ~~Map and allow explicit opt into using CultureInfo?~~ (comparer implementation-defined)
    - [x] Finish implementing AsciiIgnoreCase comparer
    - [x] Adopt the abstraction for .Contains, .IndexOf, etc.
- [x] IList, IEnumerable
- [x] Format(InterpolatedU8StringHandler)
- [ ] Construction

- [x] Runes view (IEnumerable, or stateful IList?)
    - [ ] CopyTo(span)
- [ ] U8Builder
    - [ ] Special-case `Append(byte)` (do it for interpolated handlers too)
- [x] RuneIndices / RuneOffsets / RunePositions (an advanced Runes view similar to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/28507)
    - [ ] Likely projects to (Rune, int offset), but perhaps it's better to steal RunePosition (if yes, maybe just wrap U8Scalar?)
- [x] Chars view (same as above)
    - [x] CopyTo(span)
    - [ ] Optimize `U8Chars.Enumerator` and contribute to dotnet/runtime

    - [x] parametrized Split collections (all variants)

    - [ ] `.Graphemes`
    - [ ] `.Words`
    - [ ] `.Sentences`
- [ ] Consider `.Prelude` (or `.Syntax`) namespace/static class for shorthand declaration syntax through `uisng static` e.g. `STR("Hello, world!")`, `U8(nonConstant)`, `U8($"Today is {DateTime.Now}")`, etc. Extra style points for the API being offensive to Java devs.
- [ ] Transcoding: UTF8<->UTF32
- [x] TryCreate construction variants
- [x] IsLatin/IsAlphanumeric?
- [x] Construction aligned with collection literals initialization syntax and API shape (turned out to be quite useless)
- [x] `IComparable<U8String>`, `IComparable<U8String?>`
- [x] U8Marshal
    - [x] FromBytes (or CreateUnsafe/Unchecked? Rust or Go naming?)
    - [x] ~~FromAsciiChars~~
- [x] U8Slice? U8Span? (really better not to do it because spans have special recognition by the compiler)
- [x] U8Constants
    - [x] (OS-specific) NewLine
    - [x] (OS-specific) PathSeparator
    - [x] ReplacementChar
- [x] DebuggerViewProxy
- [x] ~~Meta: improve the UX of "validate-and-move" options to construct a U8String. The implementation is really fragile to malformed UTF-8 and it is problematic to guard against it well without sacrificing a lot of performance. Therefore, it is really important not to push the users towards using the unsafe API.~~
----------------
- [ ] Extensions
    - [ ] System.Net.Http (HttpClient, HttpContent, etc.)
    - [x] System.IO (File, anything else?)
    - [ ] Streams? Pipelines?
        - [ ] U8Stream wrapper? ReadLine? Which can be applied to FileStream? The main idea is that current stream is really heavy-handed and does a lot of transcoding. There is a need for stream that would encapsulate graceful handling of advancing only to char boundaries, reading lines and streaming validation (with user-defined error handling or maybe returned OperationResult). The drawback is this adds yet another place with really large test surface area and footgun potential.
- [ ] Analyzers
    - [ ] Suppress 'use slice operator' warning for select methods like `.SliceRounding(...)`
    - [ ] Replace string literal comparison with a UTF-8 one
    - [ ] Replace direct for/foreach over a U8String with U8String.AsSpan()
    - [ ] Consider deallocating NativeU8String allocated in the current scope with `using var ...`
    - [ ] Call .Lines instead of .Split((byte)'\n')
    - [ ] Pass large structs by in or ref / ref readonly (autofixer: mutable splits and enumerations by ref / ref readonly, readonly - by in)
    - [ ] Replace predicate on LINQ projection/reduction with direct Contains/Count/etc. call
- [ ] Source Generators
    - [x] Compile-time conversion of string literals (proof of concept done)
        - [ ] Add install and uninstall scripts to add/remove to all projects (incl. interceptor toggle) in the solution (similar to OneOf?)
        - [ ] Add error fixer "add `u8(...)` to string literal to fix this error"
    - [ ] Compile-time UTF-8 validation for u8 literals and replacing the calls with unchecked variants
    - [ ] Switch map trie generator to work around C# limitations
